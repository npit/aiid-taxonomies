### AIID Taxonomies

This repository is used for backup and development of AIID technical taxonomies and annotations of AIID incidents.


Developed taxonomies include:
- `system_tasks.json`: AI system high-level tasks
- `methods_technologies.json`: AI system methods and technologies
- `failures.json`: AI system technical failures

Annotation data accrued over 41 AIID incidents are available in `annotations.json`

Documentation for the above taxonomies, their development and proposed annotation process is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ap3jHT9hFLILLHrmqjuiG8HArDS6gB9gXMO7TwJwRbI/edit?usp=sharing).
